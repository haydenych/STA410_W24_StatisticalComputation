    "   >  Seek homework partners in class, in course discussion board on piazza, etc.   \n",
    " \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Paired students each separately submit their (common) work, including (agreeing) contribution of work statements for each problem.**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "   > Students must work in accordance with the [University of Torontoâ€™s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019) (and see also http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca.); however, students working in pairs may share work without restriction within their pair. Getting and sharing \"hints\" from other classmates is encouraged; but, the eventual code creation work and submission must be your own individual or paired creation.\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. **Do not delete, replace, or rearranged cells** as this erases `cell ids` upon which automated code tests are based.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > The \"Edit > Undo Delete Cells\" option in the notebook editor might be helpful; otherwise, redownload the notebook (so it has the correct required `cells ids`) and repopulate it with your answers (assuming you don't overwrite them when you redownload the notebook).\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "4. **No cells may have any runtime errors** because this causes subsequent automated code tests to fail and you will not get marks for tests which fail because of previous runtime errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "  > Run time errors include, e.g., unassigned variables, mismatched parentheses, and any code which does not work when the notebook cells are sequentially run, even if it was provided for you as part of the starter code. ***It is best to restart and re-run the cells in your notebook to ensure there are no runtime errors before submitting your work.***\n",
    "  >\n",
    "  > - The `try`-`except` block syntax catches runtime errors and transforms them into `exceptions` which will not cause subsequent automated code tests to fail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No jupyter shortcut commands** such as `! python script.py 10` or `%%timeit` may be included in the final submission as they will cause subsequent automated code tests to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > ***Comment out ALL jupyter shortcut commands***, e.g., `# ! python script.py 10` or `# %%timeit` in submitted notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Python library imports are limited** to only libraries imported in the starter code and the [standard python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html). Importing additional libraries will cause subsequent automated code tests to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Unless a problem instructs differently, you may use any functions available from the libraries imported in the starter code; otherwise, you are expected to create your own Python functionality based on the Python stdlib (standard libary, i.e., base Python and standard Python modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. You are encouraged to adapt code you find available online into your notebook; however, if you do so please provide a link to the utilized resource. ***If failure to cite such references is identified and confirmed, your mark will be immediately reduced to 0.***  "
